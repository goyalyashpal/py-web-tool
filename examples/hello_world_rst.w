Introduction
============

This test program prints the word "hello", followed by the name of
the operating system as understood by Python.  It is implemented in
Python and uses the ``os`` module.  It builds the message string
in two different ways, and writes separate versions of the program to
two different files.

Implementation
==============

Output files
------------

This document contains the makings of two files; the first,
``test.py``, uses simple string concatenation to build its output
message:

@o hw_rst_1.py
@{
@< Import the os module @>
@< Get the OS description @>
@< Construct the message with Concatenation @>
@< Print the message @>
@}

The second uses string substitution:

@o hw_rst_2.py
@{
@< Import the os module @>
@< Get the OS description @>
@< Construct the message with Substitution @>
@< Print the message @>
@}

Retrieving the OS description
-------------------------------

First we must import the os module so we can learn about the OS:

@d Import the os module
@{
import os
@}

That having been done, we can retrieve Python's name for the OS type:

@d Get the OS description
@{
os_name = os.name
@}

Building the message
---------------------

Now, we're ready for the meat of the application: concatenating two strings:

@d Construct the message with Concatenation
@{
msg = "Hello, " + os_name + "!"
@}

But wait!  Is there a better way?  Using string substitution might be
better:

@d Construct the message with Substitution
@{
msg = f"Hello, {os_name}!" 
@}

We'll use the first of these methods in ``rst_test_1.py``, and the
other in ``rst_test_2.py``.

Printing the message
----------------------

Finally, we print the message out for the user to see.  Hopefully, a
cheery greeting will make them happy to know what operating system
they have:

@d Print the message 
@{
print(msg)
@}
