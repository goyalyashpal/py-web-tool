Definitions
===========

Here are the definitions for Ackermann's full :math:`\varphi (m,n,p)` function:

.. math::


       \varphi (m,n,p) = \begin{cases}
       \varphi (m,n,0)&=m+n\\
       \varphi (m,0,1)&=0\\
       \varphi (m,0,2)&=1\\
       \varphi (m,0,p)&=m {\textbf{ for }}p>2\\
       \varphi (m,n,p)&=\varphi (m,\varphi (m,n-1,p),p-1) {\textbf{ for }}n,p>0
       \end{cases}

These definitions have the following consequences:

.. math::


       \begin{align}
       \varphi (m,n,0)&=m+n\\
       \varphi (m,n,1)&=m\times n\\
       \varphi (m,n,2)&=m^{n}
       \end{align}

Implementations
===============

We'll look at a number of ways
to implement this.

Set Reduction
-------------

First, let's consider evaluating the conditionals into "value or None" conditions.
We can then create a set and keep the non-None items.

The set reduction involves computing a non-\ ``None`` result for the case that is true
and ``None`` result for all remaining cases. The resulting set of values will be reduced to
two items. Subtracting the ``None`` item from the set leaves the result value.

@d set reduction
@{
phi_1 = (
    lambda m, n, p: (
        {
            m+n if p == 0 else None, 
            0 if n == 0 and p == 1 else None, 
            1 if n == 0 and p == 2 else None, 
            m if n == 0 and p > 2 else None, 
            phi_1(m, phi_1(m, n-1, p), p-1) if n > 0 and p > 0 else None,
        } - {None}
    ).pop()
)
@}

@d test set reduction
@{
>>> phi_1(3, 5, 0)
8
>>> phi_1(3, 5, 1)
15
>>> phi_1(3, 5, 2)
243
>>> 3**5
243
@}


Dictionary Reduction
--------------------

We can use the condition value (``True`` or ``False``) as a dictionary
key. The value for each key is the lambda to evaluate when the key is ``True``.
Picking the ``True`` key from the dictionary maps to the applicable lambda. 
The other lambda, mapped to ``False`` can be ignored.

@d dictionary reduction
@{
phi = (
    lambda m, n, p: (
        {
            p == 0: lambda m, n, p: m+n,
            n == 0 and p == 1: lambda m, n, p: 0, 
            n == 0 and p == 2: lambda m, n, p: 1, 
            n == 0 and p > 2: lambda m, n, p: m, 
            n > 0 and p > 0: lambda m, n, p: phi(m, phi(m, n-1, p), p-1)
        }[True](m, n, p)
    )
)
@}

@d test dict reduction
@{
>>> phi(3, 5, 0) == 3+5
True
>>> phi(3, 5, 1) == 3*5
True
>>> phi(3, 5, 2) == 3**5
True
@}


Match/Case
----------

We can use Python 3.10's ``match`` statement, also.
This is generally what folks expect to see.

@d match statement
@{
def phi_m(m, n, p):
    match (m, n, p):
        case (_, _, 0):
            return m + n
        case (_, 0, 1):
            return 0
        case (_, 0, 2):
            return 1
        case (_, 0, _) if p > 2:
            return m
        case (_, _, _) if n > 0 and p > 0:
            return phi_m(m, phi_m(m, n-1, p), p-1)
@}

@d test match statemnent
@{
>>> phi_m(3, 5, 0) == 3+5
True
>>> phi_m(3, 5, 1) == 3*5
True
>>> phi_m(3, 5, 2) == 3**5
True
@}

Conclusion
==========

We've looked at three ways to define a fairly complex function with a lot of complex-looking 
special cases.

The ``match`` statement seems to fit most people's expectations of the complex-looking math.
